The basic syntax of a while loop in Python is:

while condition:
    # code to be executed repeatedly while the condition is true
Here, condition is an expression that is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the block of code indented under the while statement is executed. This process continues until the condition becomes false, at which point the loop exits and the program continues with the next statement after the loop.

It's important to ensure that the condition eventually becomes false, otherwise the loop will continue running indefinitely, which is called an infinite loop. You can use control statements like break or continue inside a loop to change the loop's behavior or exit the loop early, if necessary.

while loops are commonly used when you don't know ahead of time how many times you need to execute a block of code, or when you need to keep executing code until a certain condition is met.


example:


number = int(input('Enter a number: '))
#Above we have crating a variable name : Number under this variable we are asing user to put a input value 

count = 1
#Here on above we are creating another variable name count having value 1

while count <=10: #creating while loop 
  multiply = number * count
  #creating new variable name multiply
  
  print(number, "X", count, "=", divide)
  
  count = count +1
  
  
  Output:
  Enter a number: 6
  
  
6 X 1 = 6
6 X 2 = 12
6 X 3 = 18
6 X 4 = 24
6 X 5 = 30
6 X 6 = 36
6 X 7 = 42
6 X 8 = 48
6 X 9 = 54
6 X 10 = 60
